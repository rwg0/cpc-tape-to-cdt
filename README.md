# This Fork
This fork adds information to the read error messages to make it easier to spot what has gone wrong - it also outputs the timestamp in the audio where the problem was encountered, so you can examine the audio file and possibly fix any problem (perhaps by seeing if the audio is only bad in one of the two channels).
